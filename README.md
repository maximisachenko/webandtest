npm run dev       # Starts the development server with Turbopack for faster and optimized hot reloading
# or
npm run build     # Builds the project for production environment, minifies and optimizes the files
# or
npm run start     # Starts the application in production mode after running npm run build
```
If necessary, check the code:
```
npm run lint      # Runs the linter (eslint) to check the code for style issues and prevent errors
